Objective: To complete Credit analysis using various factors from a dataset, and create a model that will determine loan approval based on these factors.

Factors: Income, number of dependents , reason of loan (Only for housing), length of loan,Co-Dependent income, Loan amount and many more.
Data Cleaning: Filling of na values using pandas and SMOTE to prevent Oversampling.

Machine Learning Models: Neural Networks (Pytorch Deep Learning), Cat-Boost, Gaussian Naive Bayes,Random Forest, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression.

Result: ~87% Accuracy was the highest achieved among all the models.This was Achieved by Random Forest.
